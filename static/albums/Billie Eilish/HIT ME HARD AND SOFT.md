## Description

My love for Billie Eilish and her music goes all the way back to when I heard Bad Guy, which is still one of my favorite songs from her.
This album was not an immediate regular listen from me though. I'm not sure why, it could be because it released during a very busy time of my
life (I was about to get married). Regardless, it is now one of my favorite albums, and one of my favorite of Billie's albums!

FINNEAS is an **amazing** producer, and you can hear it in this. The spacey guitars in **Lunch**, the drums in like every song on here,
the boomy 808 basses contrasted with fuzzy sawtooth basses. It's all so good. And I love that they still record their music together even
after they found all the success that they did. 

And it goes without saying, but Billie Eilish is a beautiful vocalist. She doesn't use heavy autotune (well, except for that one part
in *L'AMOUR DE MA VIE*, but you know) and she painstakingly records her vocals, recording many many many takes and layering many of together.

I made the joke about *L'AMOUR DE MA VIE*, but it is probably my favorite on here. 

I also have very happy memories of recent listening to this album with my wife and some of our friends, they really opened my eyes to how great
an album it is!

## Description

While this one was added to my collection recently, my first experience with it goes back to 2023 when it first released. I was driving to 
visit my family and my wife put it on. Ever since then, I have been in love with it. And as Chappell Roan has skyrocketed to fame, I love
everything about what she is doing. Queer representation in the mainstream music scene is a breath of fresh air.

Musically, I love the production on this one. The drums on *Femininomenon* are so groovy and punchy. The vocals on *Red Wine Supernova*
are so well done and I love the melodies so much. I also love the guitar that comes in at the intro. Obviously, I love *Hot to Go*, and
at some point in 2024 I actually wrote a marching band arrangement of it when I was learning MuseScore 4! I **love** the synth sound on that one;
it is so retro yet modern. *Pink Pony Club* needs no introduction, but one thing I particularly like is that it has **a guitar solo!!**

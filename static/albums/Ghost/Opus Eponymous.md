## Description

When I first was introduced to Ghost by a good friend at university (circa 2017), I was unsure what to think about this album.
I did not know much about the Swedish black metal scene that Ghost came out of, and while I loved the lyrics, I was rather
uncomfortable by the lyrical themes. Fast forward to 2024 and I was very much not as bothered by it. I got into a major Ghost
phase and started listening to every album. Needless to say, I really love this one now. 

In particular, my favorite song on this is *Ritual*. That main riff is so heavy, and it is extremely fun to play. It does remind me
a little of *Symphony of Destruction* by Megadeth, which I also love. *Stand By Him* is another song that I love musically, but it also
highlights the nuance of the lyrics that Tobias Forge writes for his songs. The lyrics follow along with the Satanic imagery of the rest of the album,
but notably this song delves into themes of witch hunts and discusses a woman being burned at the stake on suspicion of being a witch. Finally, the song
*Satan Prayer* has become another frequent listen of mine, because when I got to go see Ghost live in July 2025, Papa V led into this song by
playing *Satanized* and then saying "Let's see just how *Satanized* you really are!" and I just loved that transition.

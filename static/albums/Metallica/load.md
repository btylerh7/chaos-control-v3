## Description

I have always been a huge Metallica fan. When I was building a CD collection in the early 2010s as a middle-schooler, I was already
buying up Metallica albums. I had *Master of Puppets* and *...And Justice For All* back then. I can tell you all about the history of the
band, about the countless guitar riffs and licks I have learned of theirs. But *Load* and *Reload* were albums I had never really given
time to. 

I guess maybe I heard the opinions about how drastically different they were from previous Metallica albums and decided it wasn't for me?
Or perhaps I just never got around to listening to it. Either way, fast forward to June 2025. Metallica released a box remastered CD of the album,
and this was around the time I was starting to finally add to my CD collection after many years. So naturally, I got it.

When I say I loved this album, I really mean it. I can tell all the flaws that many people commonly say about the writing, some of the repetitiveness, etc.
But this album is so fun. In particular, I was already very familiar with *King Nothing*. I remember playing Guitar Hero Metallica to that one with my brother
(or maybe he was just watching, I don't remember). The song *Ain't My Bitch* was in particular an amazing experience for me. I absolutely love the opening
riff, and I spent many hours that month trying to learn it. It's got such an odd timing yet it is in a regular time signature.

My CD case is unfortunately not in good condition already. The first week I had it, I left it in the car with no cd in the case and the plastic melted.
But it is okay. It is such a good album.

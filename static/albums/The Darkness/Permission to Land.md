## Description

Let me just tell you that when I say this is one of my favorite albums of all time, I am not exaggerating. I **love** this album.
I had a friend in high school who put me onto this band and this album in particular, and it is one of those albums where I can just 
put it on and play along on my guitar and have so much fun. 

You probably know **I Believe in a Thing Called Love* if you know this band at all, but beyond that, there are so many bangers on this
album. Vocalist Justin Hawkins has an amazing falsetto, and he is not afraid to use it. He and his brother Dan do a sort of co-lead guitar on
most of the album, with some great solos from Dan being the intro to *Love is Only a Feeling*, and a great Justin solo being the first and last solos
of *I Believe in a Thing Called Love*.

Funny enough, I learned a lot of these songs without watching the live videos of the band, so I did not realize just how many solos on here are 
actually played by Justin until I saw them live in September 2025 (that was an amazing night). Truly a must-listen if you like 80s inspired hard
rock. Typically they are described as AC/DC meets Queen, and I agree. Speaking of AC/DC, the intro to *Black Shuck* is one of my favorite guitar
riffs ever!
